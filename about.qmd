## Intersectional Work Discrimination Scale Development

This study aims to develop and validate a comprehensive scale for measuring intersectional work discrimination across multiple identities in community psychologists' work units. We adapted and combined two existing scales—the Intersectional Discrimination Index (InDI-D) and the Chronic Work Discrimination and Harassment scale (CWDHS)—to assess the day-to-day and chronic discriminatory experiences faced by individuals in their professional environments. Through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and parallel analysis, we identified key dimensions of discrimination based on gender, race, and other intersecting identities. The final factor analysis resulted in a one-factor model capturing the core of intersectional work discrimination, with all factor loadings above 0.4. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering multiple identity categories when studying workplace discrimination, particularly in professional settings where individuals may experience unique forms of exclusion and bias. This scale offers a robust tool for future research on work unit discrimination and can be adapted for use in various organizational contexts.

## SAK Law Reform Text Anyalysis

This project applies a qualitative content analysis to U.S. state-level Sexual Assault Kit (SAK) submission laws to examine whether the language used in legislation predicts the adoption of reform measures. Using Bernard, Wutich, and Ryan’s (2017) 7-step content analysis framework, I combined ChatGPT and R’s `tidytext` package to code each law according to three theoretically grounded themes: Survivor vs. Victim Language, Trauma-Informed Language, and Permissive vs. Directive Language. A custom sentiment lexicon was developed through iterative prompting and refinement with ChatGPT. Each law was analyzed to identify the presence or absence of thematic language, and regression models were used to test whether these themes predicted the number of pillars a state achieved, as defined by End the Backlog. Results suggest that while language alone did not significantly predict outcomes, directive and trauma-informed language showed positive trends, and the presence of any SAK law was strongly associated with reform progress. This analysis demonstrates the potential of integrating AI-assisted coding with R for critical policy analysis.
