    "text": "Community Psychology is a somewhat young field of psychology, with the coining of the term in 1966 marking the beginning of the discipline (Bennett et al., 1966). Since then, community psychologists (CPs) have integrated and worked in a variety of settings including both academic/research orientated positions and more practice/applied settings. However, unlike other fields, understanding of the experiences of CPs has yet to be fully explored. Thus, a study was proposed by the Society for Community Research and Actions (SCRA) to gather information on the types of settings and experiences of community psychologist, specifically of those who are the lone CP in their work unit.\nPart one of the study included a survey, which needed to include a section to measure discrimination to assess this aspect of CPs experiences. However, there are few studies that look at a person’s intersectional identity as whole regarding their experiences with discrimination in the workplace (Scheim & Bauer, 2019). There are some scales that look at specific cross-section of an identity, such as Gendered Racial Microaggressions Scale for Black women and many that looks at racial discrimination (Lewis & Neville, 2015; Williams, 2016). Consequently, as Scheim & Bauer (2019) noted, it has become common to adapt racial discrimination scales to fit a more intercategorical scope, such as with this survey. Yet, by adapting these scales, and in our case also adapting them to also be specific to a work unit, it can limit their validity. Thus, by combining and adapting two scales, one that is intersectional in nature but does not focus on workplace discrimination, and a second one that is racially focused but designed to measure workplace discrimination, we hope to create a scale that captures overall discrimination experiences based on all aspects of a person’s identity in the workplace.",

    "text": "Methods\n\nSample\nParticipants were recruited using the SCRA listserv. To qualify for participation, survey takers were required to be 18 years or older and self-identify as a community psychologist. The survey was first sent out on June 14, 2020, on the listserv, with reminders every 2 weeks, until the survey closed on August 31, 2020. A total of 194 responses were collected for this study, but 75 responses were not used in this analysis. Specifically, 55 were taken out due not taking the survey and 20 were taken out due to incomplete surveys. The final sample consisted of 119 participants.\n\n\nMeasures\n\nIntersectional discrimination index.\nThe Intersectional Discrimination Index, specifically the lifetime day-to-day discrimination subscale, (InDI-D; Scheim & Bauer, 2019) was used to measure overall day to day discrimination but was edited to be specific for the work unit. It consists of 9 items and uses a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (Once a week or more) to 5 (Never). Example items include, “Because of who you are, have you… Heard, saw, or read others in your work unit joking or laughing about you (or people like you),” and “…Been treated as if others in your work unit are afraid of you.”\n\n\nChronic Work Discrimination and Harassment.\nA subset of The Chronic Work Discrimination and Harassment scale (Bennett, Anderson, Cooper, Hassol, & Klein, 1966; Bobo, & Suh, 2000). was used to measure discrimination with items more geared to the work environment. The total scale has 12 items, but only 8 items were used to shorten the length of the survey. Additionally, this scale was made specifically for racial discrimination and was edited to ask about overall discriminatory experience, rather than just those racially targeted. All items use a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (Once a week or more) to 5 (Never). Example items include, “Because of who you are, have you…Witnessed your supervisor or boss use bigoted slurs or jokes,” and “…Had to work twice as hard as others in your work unit.”\n\n\nDemographics.\nThe participants were asked to identify their race and/or ethnicity based on the planned racial/ethnic categories for the 2020 U.S. Census (allowed to check more than one category), then to identify their race and/or ethnicity in a free response, what country they worked in, if they identify as LBGTQIA+, then to identify their sexual orientation in a free response, their gender identity in a free response, and finally if they have a disability or consider themselves otherly abled.",

We then visualized the data using histograms, tables, and correlation plots to see what the response distrubtion looked like for each item on both scales.\n\n\nExplore Dimenstionality\nThen we started the test of dimensionality by conducting a Scree test that yielded three factors above the scree line (Kaiser 1960). However, a parallel analysis with 1000 iterations only found two factors passing the 95% threshold (Horn, 1973). Based on this, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with oblemin rotation and two factors was conducted to understand the underlying structure of the 17 items. Most items loaded onto the first factor, with items 103, 104, 105, and 106 from the Chronic Work Discrimination and Harassment scale having the highest loadings on the second factor (0.849, 0.824, 0.498, and 0.793, respectively).

These two items were excluded as they were highly correlated with both items 104 and 105, thus not adding value and being redundant to the scale (see Figure 7 for correlations).

    "text": "Discussion\nAs the community psychology field continues to grow, and the workforce continues to diversify, understanding employees’ experiences with discrimination across intersecting identities will become increasingly important. While this scale developed used a sample of only community psychologist, they do work in a variety of settings and are often the only CP in their setting which can be further isolating, exacerbating any discriminatory experiences. By combining these two scales, we are better able to gather information on people’s experiences with discrimination based on multiple parts of individual’s identity, while also keeping it brief.\nOverall, these results support the day-to-day subscale of the InDI, which had not been analyzed in this manner before. However, this also demonstrated that redundancy of some items in the Chronic Work Discrimination and Harassment scale. Specifically, the questions regarding the use of bigoted slurs and jokes in the workplace. Based on this, reducing these questions two to questions either focusing on supervisor versus colleagues, or general use versus comments directed at the individual may serve to provide more nuanced information without redundancy. Some limitations of this study are again, the sample being solely made of CPs.\nTo further validate this scale, another sample with individuals from various fields would showcase if these results would hold outside of community psychology. Additionally, getting a larger sample to be would allow for both a derivative and validation sample. This would allow for better assessment of the scale’s validity. Moreover, in this survey, follow-up questions were asked after each item to see what identity was being targeted by the discriminatory action. This should be further analyzed to see how if the results of scale are gathering information on an array of discriminatory experiences rather than only one (such as solely measuring discriminatory experiences based on race). This would be a good avenue for further research.",

    "text": "This study aims to develop and validate a comprehensive scale for measuring intersectional work discrimination across multiple identities in community psychologists’ work units. We adapted and combined two existing scales—the Intersectional Discrimination Index (InDI-D) and the Chronic Work Discrimination and Harassment scale (CWDHS)—to assess the day-to-day and chronic discriminatory experiences faced by individuals in their professional environments. Through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and parallel analysis, we identified key dimensions of discrimination based on gender, race, and other intersecting identities. The final factor analysis resulted in a one-factor model capturing the core of intersectional work discrimination, with all factor loadings above 0.4. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering multiple identity categories when studying workplace discrimination, particularly in professional settings where individuals may experience unique forms of exclusion and bias. This scale offers a robust tool for future research on work unit discrimination and can be adapted for use in various organizational contexts.",

    "text": "This study aims to develop and validate a comprehensive scale for measuring intersectional work discrimination across multiple identities in community psychologists’ work units. We adapted and combined two existing scales—the Intersectional Discrimination Index (InDI-D) and the Chronic Work Discrimination and Harassment scale (CWDHS)—to assess the day-to-day and chronic discriminatory experiences faced by individuals in their professional environments. Through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and parallel analysis, we identified key dimensions of discrimination based on gender, race, and other intersecting identities. The final factor analysis resulted in a one-factor model capturing the core of intersectional work discrimination, with all factor loadings above 0.4. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering multiple identity categories when studying workplace discrimination, particularly in professional settings where individuals may experience unique forms of exclusion and bias. This scale offers a robust tool for future research on work unit discrimination and can be adapted for use in various organizational contexts.",
